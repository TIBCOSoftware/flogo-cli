*Create a flogo application project from an existing flogo application descriptor.*
	
	flogo create -f myapp.json
		
### install
This command is used to install a contribution to your project.

*activity*

	flogo install github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log
	
*trigger*

	flogo install github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest
	
	
### uninstall
This command is used to remove a contribution to your project.

*activity*

	flogo uninstall github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log
	
*trigger*

	flogo uninstall github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest
	
### list
This command is used to list the activities, triggers, flows and models installed in the application.  
	 
	flogo list
	
	actions:
	  github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/action/flow
	activities:
	  github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log
	flow-model:
	  github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/model/simple
	triggers:
	  github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest

The list can be generated in a JSON format using the 'json' flag

	flogo list -json
	[
	  {
	    "type": "action",
	    "ref": "github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/action/flow"
	  },
	  {
	    "type": "activity",
	    "ref": "github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log"
	  },
	  {
	    "type": "flow-model",
	    "ref": "github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/model/simple"
	  },

### prepare
This command is used to prepare the application. Preperation consist of code generation for contribution metadata and go imports.

 	flogo prepare
 	
**options**
	
- [ -o ] : optimize compilation, compiled application will only contain contribution directly referenced in the flogo.json
- [ -e ] : embeds the configuration into the compiled application	 	 

### build
This command is used to build the application.  The *prepare* command is also invoked by default when doing a build.

 	flogo build
 	
**options**
	
- [ -o ] : optimize compilation, compiled application will only contain contribution directly referenced in the flogo.json
- [ -e ] : embeds the configuration into the compiled application
- [ -sp ] : skip *prepare* step

### help
This command is used to display help on a particular command
	
	flogo help build 

##Application Project

###Structure

The create command creates a basic structure and files for an application.


	my_app/
		flogo.json
		src/
			my_app/
				imports.go
				main.go
		vendor/
		
**files**

- *flogo.json* : flogo project application configuration descriptor file
- *imports.go* : contains go imports for contributions (activities, triggers and models) used by the application
- *main.go* : main file for the engine.

**directories**	
	
- *vendor* : go libraries
